Hi, I'm Tim Hunter. 

Currently a grad student at Western University, I'm working in the field of computational medicine. My research is focused on enriching experimentally/clinically acquired data through computer simulation of biophysical systems, with the end goal of improving clinical outcomes for patients.
Through my studies I've become interested in software development, so here is where all my research and other projects live!

Languages I'm currently working with include:
- python
- MATLAB
- c/c++

If you want to collaborate on a project, feel free to reach out!
