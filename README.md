# Tim Hunter

Hi, I'm Tim Hunter. 

Currently a grad student at Western University, I'm working in the field of computational medicine. My research is focused on enriching experimentally/clinically acquired data through computer simulation of biophysical systems, with the end goal of improving clinical outcomes for patients.
Through my studies I've become interested in software development, so here is where all my research and personal projects live!

I'm currently learning how to become a full-stack developer by developing a food and recipe management app using the MERN stack.

If you want to collaborate on a project, feel free to reach out!
